# Stereo-Audio-Dectector-v2

Stereo Audio Detector: Precision rectifiers and integrators for driving VU displays.

This analog cirucit is intended to handle "front-end" conditioning for VU meters, but could be used for any low-frequency analog AC signal where the envelope of the waveform is of interest. The schmatic has several notes for changing values for different purposes.
The original intention was as VU meter front-end for Arduino or Teensy microcontrollers to use to "talk" to the Stereo VU Meter display, also published under my github account.
